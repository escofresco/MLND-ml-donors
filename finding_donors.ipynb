    "## Getting Started\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, you will employ several supervised algorithms of your choice to accurately model individuals' income using data collected from the 1994 U.S. Census. You will then choose the best candidate algorithm from preliminary results and further optimize this algorithm to best model the data. Your goal with this implementation is to construct a model that accurately predicts whether an individual makes more than $50,000. This sort of task can arise in a non-profit setting, where organizations survive on donations.  Understanding an individual's income can help a non-profit better understand how large of a donation to request, or whether or not they should reach out to begin with.  While it can be difficult to determine an individual's general income bracket directly from public sources, we can (as we will see) infer this value from other publically available features. \n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset for this project originates from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Census+Income). The datset was donated by Ron Kohavi and Barry Becker, after being published in the article _\"Scaling Up the Accuracy of Naive-Bayes Classifiers: A Decision-Tree Hybrid\"_. You can find the article by Ron Kohavi [online](https://www.aaai.org/Papers/KDD/1996/KDD96-033.pdf). The data we investigate here consists of small changes to the original dataset, such as removing the `'fnlwgt'` feature and records with missing or ill-formatted entries."

    "For highly-skewed feature distributions such as `'capital-gain'` and `'capital-loss'`, it is common practice to apply a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_transformation_(statistics)\">logarithmic transformation</a> on the data so that the very large and very small values do not negatively affect the performance of a learning algorithm. Using a logarithmic transformation significantly reduces the range of values caused by outliers. Care must be taken when applying this transformation however: The logarithm of `0` is undefined, so we must translate the values by a small amount above `0` to apply the the logarithm successfully.\n",

Applying a scaling to the data does not change the shape of each feature's distribution (such as `'capital-gain'` or `'capital-loss'` above); however, normalization ensures that each feature is treated equally when applying supervised learners. Note that once scaling is applied, observing the data in its raw form will no longer have the same original meaning, as exampled below.\n",
    "\n",
    "Run the code cell below to normalize each numerical feature. We will use [`sklearn.preprocessing.MinMaxScaler`](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.preprocessing.MinMaxScaler.html) for this."

    "From the table in **Exploring the Data** above, we can see there are several features for each record that are non-numeric. Typically, learning algorithms expect input to be numeric, which requires that non-numeric features (called *categorical variables*) be converted. One popular way to convert categorical variables is by using the **one-hot encoding** scheme. One-hot encoding creates a _\"dummy\"_ variable for each possible category of each non-numeric feature. For example, assume `someFeature` has three possible entries: `A`, `B`, or `C`. We then encode this feature into `someFeature_A`, `someFeature_B` and `someFeature_C`.\n",

    "| 2 |  A  |  | 1 | 0 | 0 |\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, as with the non-numeric features, we need to convert the non-numeric target label, `'income'` to numerical values for the learning algorithm to work. Since there are only two possible categories for this label (\"<=50K\" and \">50K\"), we can avoid using one-hot encoding and simply encode these two categories as `0` and `1`, respectively. In code cell below, you will need to implement the following:\n",
    " - Use [`pandas.get_dummies()`](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.get_dummies.html?highlight=get_dummies#pandas.get_dummies) to perform one-hot encoding on the `'features_log_minmax_transform'` data.\n",

    "### Metrics and the Naive Predictor\n",
    "*CharityML*, equipped with their research, knows individuals that make more than \\$50,000 are most likely to donate to their charity. Because of this, *CharityML* is particularly interested in predicting who makes more than \\$50,000 accurately. It would seem that using **accuracy** as a metric for evaluating a particular model's performace would be appropriate. Additionally, identifying someone that *does not* make more than \\$50,000 as someone who does would be detrimental to *CharityML*, since they are looking to find individuals willing to donate. Therefore, a model's ability to precisely predict those that make more than \\$50,000 is *more important* than the model's ability to **recall** those individuals. We can use **F-beta score** as a metric that considers both precision and recall:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ F_{\\beta} = (1 + \\beta^2) \\cdot \\frac{precision \\cdot recall}{\\left( \\beta^2 \\cdot precision \\right) + recall} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "In particular, when $\\beta = 0.5$, more emphasis is placed on precision. This is called the **F$_{0.5}$ score** (or F-score for simplicity).\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking at the distribution of classes (those who make at most \\$50,000, and those who make more), it's clear most individuals do not make more than \\$50,000. This can greatly affect **accuracy**, since we could simply say *\"this person does not make more than \\$50,000\"* and generally be right, without ever looking at the data! Making such a statement would be called **naive**, since we have not considered any information to substantiate the claim. It is always important to consider the *naive prediction* for your data, to help establish a benchmark for whether a model is performing well. That been said, using that prediction would be pointless: If we predicted all people made less than \\$50,000, *CharityML* would identify no one as donors. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Note: Recap of accuracy, precision, recall\n",
    "\n",
    "** Accuracy ** measures how often the classifier makes the correct prediction. It’s the ratio of the number of correct predictions to the total number of predictions (the number of test data points).\n",
    "\n",
    "** Precision ** tells us what proportion of messages we classified as spam, actually were spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all positives(all words classified as spam, irrespective of whether that was the correct classificatio), in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Positives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "** Recall(sensitivity)** tells us what proportion of messages that actually were spam were classified by us as spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all the words that were actually spam, in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Negatives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "For classification problems that are skewed in their classification distributions like in our case, for example if we had a 100 text messages and only 2 were spam and the rest 98 weren't, accuracy by itself is not a very good metric. We could classify 90 messages as not spam(including the 2 that were spam but we classify them as not spam, hence they would be false negatives) and 10 as spam(all 10 false positives) and still get a reasonably good accuracy score. For such cases, precision and recall come in very handy. These two metrics can be combined to get the F1 score, which is weighted average(harmonic mean) of the precision and recall scores. This score can range from 0 to 1, with 1 being the best possible F1 score(we take the harmonic mean as we are dealing with ratios)."

    "* RandomForestClassifier\n",
    "    * There are only a handful of weather services that provide the bulk of data for weather forecasts. One model may predict snow, another may not. In these cases, a Random Forest Classifier can mitigate conflicting models by classifying each one by its predictability.\n",
    "    * Strengths:\n",
    "        * Handles categorical, qualitative data well.\n",
    "        * Output is predictible since all models are averaged.\n",
    "    * Weaknesses:\n",
    "        * Tends to overfit when:\n",
    "            * Data is noisy\n",
    "            * Tree is too deep\n",
    "    * Ensemble learning is relevant to problems that face high dimensional spaces. Since a single model tends to be limited by generalization, aggregating several models together increases accuracy of the final output.\n",
    "* GaussianNB\n",
    "    * Naive Bayesian classification could be used to filter email spam. \n",
    "    * Strengths:\n",
    "        * Few parameters means less overfitting.\n",
    "        * Computationally inexpensive.\n",
    "        * Compatible with high-dimensional problems.\n",
    "        * Handles noisy, dirty data well.\n",
    "    * Weaknesses:\n",
    "        * Requires large datasets.\n",
    "        * Poor generalization.\n",
    "        * Depends on the *conditional independence assumption*. (Parameters are independent of eachother.)(1)\n",
    "    * This model appropriately handles this project's 100+ features, and will run quickly, even on an old laptop.\n",
    "* SVC\n",
    "    * Support vector machines, in general, are useful for sentiment analysis. As a classifier, SVCs would be useful for deciding affect of Amazon reviews.\n",
    "    * Strengths:\n",
    "        * Generalizes to high-dimensional spaces.\n",
    "            * Aptly avoids the *curse of dimensionality*, making SVCs compatible with dense feature sets.\n",
    "        * Ignores distance between inputs.\n",
    "        * Uses simple regression for categorization.\n",
    "    * Weaknesses:\n",
    "        * Sensitive to *ground truth*.\n",
    "            * Data sets must be collected by people who have concensus around how this information ought to be classified (2). \n",
    "    * This model uses the decision boundary method to handle lots of features without incuring the *curse of dimensionality*. Considering that there are over a hundred features and two outputs, an SVC can be expected to construct a model that produces similar results between training and testing.\n",

    "The final model is an amalgamation of ensemble learning and decision trees, called a Random Forest Classifier. Decision trees are a relatively simple classifier; by organizing training data as a tree, every outcome is fit to a series of if-then statements (1). If there is no limit to the length of this series, then the final tree will fit training data perfectly. This isn't good if the tree is used to predict anything other than training data, which it is. Ensemble learning is a common solution.\n",

    "Ensemble learning isn't a method per se. Instead, a model is aggregated over many instances to produce predictable, consistent results (3). Random forests are an ensemble (aggregation) of decision trees (model), each of which has been generated by a single *induction algorithm*(4) and subsequently altered randomly. \n",

    "**Answer:**\n",
    "Of the five top features, I guessed two correctly. And after reviewing the full description for each feature, the feature importances above make more sense. For instance, *education-num* seems like a more interpretable way of representing education. I originally considered *marital-status* because it seemed like a feature specific to income ranges around 50k. Instead, I chose *capital-loss* as (4). In retrospect I see *capital-gain*, alone, as sufficient. I didn't, however, consider *hours-per-week* for specific reasons. One of them was that members with high income work less than those with lower income since I thought high income would be derived passively, such as from dividends."

    "How does a model perform if we only use a subset of all the available features in the data? With less features required to train, the expectation is that training and prediction time is much lower — at the cost of performance metrics. From the visualization above, we see that the top five most important features contribute more than half of the importance of **all** features present in the data. This hints that we can attempt to *reduce the feature space* and simplify the information required for the model to learn. The code cell below will use the same optimized model you found earlier, and train it on the same training set *with only the top five important features*. "
